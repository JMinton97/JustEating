This app was developed for the Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing module at University of Birmingham, March 2019. Using the FSA's [food hygiene rating API](https://api.ratings.food.gov.uk/help), it allows users to
* Search for establishments across the UK by name
* Filter searches by business type, region, local authority, and hygiene rating
* Search for local establishments within a specified radius of the user's current location
* Sort results by rating, date of rating and distance (if performing a location search)
* View the food hygiene rating and full breakdown for any establishment, along with the address, and view the location in a map application
* Save an establishment as a favourite for quick access from a favourites menu
* Take a photo of an establishment, overlay the name and rating of the establishment on the photo, and share the resulting image.
